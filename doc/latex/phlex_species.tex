Chemical species in the \mbox{\hyperlink{phlex_chem}{phlex-\/chem}} module are gas-\/ or aerosol-\/phase species that can participate in chemical or phase-\/transfer reactions in the \mbox{\hyperlink{phlex_mechanism}{mechanism(s)}}. Each species must have a unique name (the same name cannot be used for a gas-\/phase species and an aerosol-\/phase species). Chemical species may be present either in the gas-\/phase or any number of \mbox{\hyperlink{phlex_aero_phase}{aerosol phases}}. For example, an aerosol-\/phase chemical species may be present in an \char`\"{}organic\char`\"{} and an \char`\"{}aqueous\char`\"{} \mbox{\hyperlink{phlex_aero_phase}{aerosol phase}}.

Chemical species data include physical constants and species-\/specific model parameters that are used during initialization to assemble reaction and sub-\/model data for use during solving. Note that chemical species data are {\bfseries only} available during initialization, and when using M\+PI are not passed to child nodes. The primary node will, however, have access to data in the {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{structpmc__phlex__core_1_1phlex__core__t_aff3bb5cb12638af6de6ee3b8b65a1fb3}{pmc\+\_\+phlex\+\_\+core\+::phlex\+\_\+core\+\_\+t\+::chem\+\_\+spec\+\_\+data}}} object for outputing model data (e.\+g., species names).

The input format for chemical species can be found \mbox{\hyperlink{input_format_species}{here}}.
