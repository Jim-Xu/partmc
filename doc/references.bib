abstract = {This chapter describes the manner in which gas-phase chemistry is treated in the Models-3 Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) modeling system. The CMAQ system currently includes two chemical mechanisms --RADM2 and CB4 --with plans to incorporate a third --the SAPRC97 mechanism --in the near future. Each of these mechanisms is described, and the manner in which the first two are linked to the aqueous chemistry and aerosol formation processes is discussed. Enhanced isoprene chemistry that has been included in the RADM2 mechanism is also described, and procedures for entering new chemical mechanisms in the CMAQ system are addressed. The representation of reaction kinetics in the CMAQ system and the numerical modeling of gas-phase chemistry are also presented. The CMAQ system currently employs two numerical solvers, SMVGEAR and a variant of the QSSA method. The numerical procedures used in each are presented, and the relative computational efficiencies of each on different computing platforms are noted.},
