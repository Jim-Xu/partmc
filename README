Dependencies
============

Required dependencies:

   * Fortran 90 compiler
   * cmake version 2.6 or higher - <http://www.cmake.org/>
   * NetCDF - <http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/>

Optional dependencies:

   * MOSAIC - Available from Rahul Zaveri - <Rahul.Zaveri@pnl.gov>
   * gnuplot - <http://www.gnuplot.info/>

PartMC can be compiled out-of-the-box on Linux under Fedora, Ubuntu,
or openSUSE if the following packages are installed:

   * Fedora 11: `gcc-gfortran`, `cmake`, `netcdf-devel`, `gnuplot`
   * Ubuntu 9.04: `gfortran`, `cmake`, `libnetcdf-dev`, `gnuplot`
   * openSUSE 11.1: `gcc-fortran`, `cmake`, `libnetcdf-devel`, `gnuplot`

PartMC will also compile out-of-the-box on OS X 10.5 using Fink (see
<http://www.finkproject.org/>) if the following packages are
installed: `gcc44`, `cmake`, `netcdf`, `netcdf-gfortran`, `gnuplot`.

The recommended version of MOSAIC for this release of PartMC is:

   * mosaic-2009-06-15


Installation
============

In principle PartMC should compile under any modern OS. Testing has
mainly been under Linux and OS X. The quick-start instructions are:

1. Install cmake and NetCDF (see above). The NetCDF libraries are
   required to compile PartMC. The `netcdf.mod` Fortran 90 module file
   is required, and it must be produced by the same compiler being
   used to compile PartMC.

2. Unpack PartMC:

        tar xzvf partmc-1.2.0.tar.gz

3. Change into the main PartMC directory (where this README file is
   located):

        cd partmc-1.2.0

4. Make a directory called `build` and change into it:

        mkdir build
        cd build

5. Run cmake with the main PartMC directory as an argument (note the
   double-c):

        ccmake ..

6. Inside ccmake press `c` to configure, edit the values as needed,
   press `c` again, then `g` to generate.

7. Compile PartMC and test it as follows. Some tests may fail due to
   bad random initial conditions, so re-run the tests a few times to
   see if failures persist.

        make
        make test

8. To run just a single test do something like:

        ctest -R poisson # argument is a regexp for test names

9. To see what make is doing run it like:

        VERBOSE=1 make

10. To run tests with visible output or to make some plots from the
    tests run them as:

        cd run_test/emission
        ./run_test_1.sh                       # similary for other tests
        gnuplot -persist plot_species.gnuplot # etc...

11. There is a complete scenario run under the `urban_plume/`
    directory. From this directory do:

        ./run.sh
        ./process.sh
        gnuplot -persist plot_aero_species_wc.gnuplot
        # similarly for other plots

PartMC can interface to the MOSAIC chemistry code (see above for
availability) but this is not enabled by default. To use MOSAIC, set
the `ENABLE_MOSAIC` variable to `ON` in cmake. The
`MOSAIC_INCLUDE_DIR` variable should be the location of the MOSAIC
module files (compiled with the same compiler), probably ending in
`mosaic/datamodules`. The `MOSAIC_LIB` variable should end in
something like `mosaic/libmosaic.a`.


Usage
=====

The main `partmc` command reads `.spec` files and does the run
specified therein. Either particle-resolved runs, sectional-code runs,
or exact solutions can be generated. A run produces one NetCDF file
per timestep, containing per-particle data (from particle-resolved
runs) or binned data (from sectional or exact runs). The `extract_*`
programs in the `tool/` directory can read these per-timestep NetCDF
files and output ASCII data (the `extract_sectional_*` programs are
used for sectional and exact model output).


ChangeLog
=========

1.2.1 - 2010-04-26

  - Specified the appropriate MOSAIC version in README.

  - Added restart capability from NetCDF state files.

1.2.0 - 2009-06-15

  * Output of full per-particle data in NetCDF format.

  * `urban_plume` test-case added, as described in the paper
    <http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2008JD011073>.

  * Build system switched to `cmake`.

  * Automated test suite added (`make test`).

1.1.0 - 2008-02-17

  * Internal reorganization to use Fortran 90 derived types for the
    data structures.

  * Integration with the MOSAIC gas- and aerosol-chemistry code.

  * Output is in binary NetCDF format.

  * Parallel implementation using 1D mixing.

1.0.0 - 2007-02-26
