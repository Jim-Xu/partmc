Sedimentation Exponential Test-case
===================================

The initial condition is a single species of particle with an
exponential distribution and the simulation using the sedimentation
kernel. No analytical solution is known for this case, so a sectional
code is used as verification. By default this testcase uses 10^6
particles, which is not enough to resolve the larger peak in the
volume density. Increasing to 10^7 or 10^8 particles fixes this at the
expense of a longer computation.

This test-case demonstrates the use of the sectional model and
comparison of sectional runs with Monte Carlo runs.
