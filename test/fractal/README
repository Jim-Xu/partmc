Brownian coagulation with fractal treatment Test-case
======================================================

The initial condition is a single species of particle with a
monodisperse distribution and the simulation uses the Brownian coagulation
kernel from the following two papers for both continuum and
free molecular regimes:
1. S. Vemury and S. E. Pratsinis, Self-preserving size distributions
of agglomerates, Journal of Aerosol Science, Vol. 26, No. 2,
pp. 175-185, 1995.
2. K.-H. Naumann, COSIMA - a computer program simulating the dynamics
of fractal aerosols, Journal of Aerosol Science, Vol. 34, No. 10,
pp. 1371-1397, 2003.

The fractal treatment is based on Naumann [2003] with prescribed
fractal parameters including fractal dimension, radius of primary
particles and volume filling factor in the spec file.

test_fractal_1: test of various radii conversions
test_fractal_2: number concentration decay for free molecular regime,
df = 2.4. Run plot_dimless_time_free_df_2_4.gnuplot for comparison result.
test_fractal_3: number concentration decay for continuum regime,
df = 1.8. Run plot_dimless_time_cont_df_1_8.gnuplot for comparison result.

This test-case demonstrates that PartMC can succesfully reproduce
the self-preserving size distributions and time evolutions of
particle number concentration reported in the literature when
Brownian coagulation is the dominant scheme for the evolution of particles.
