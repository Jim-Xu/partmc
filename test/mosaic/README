MOSAIC Test-case
================

This tests the interface to the MOSAIC chemistry code. The number of
aerosol particles is fixed at 3 and there is no coagulation. Only
chemistry and aerosol-gas transfers occur. This also tests the full
state output and post-processing capabilities of PartMC, as well as
the ability to restart the simulation from a save stated file. The
small graph symbols derived from post-processing should overlay the
lines (original output), and the large symbols derived from the
restarted simulation should overlay both for the second half of the
simulation time period.
